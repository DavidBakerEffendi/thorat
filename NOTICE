**Original Work Notice:**  
The original project (rajiv-thorat/benchmark-for-taint-analysis-tools-for-python) did not include a license and remains under its author's copyright.  
This waiver applies only to changes made by David Baker Effendi after forking.

While this repository has transformed the original substantially, some test cases remain in tact, so please take care.
